# Booth-s-Algorithm-Assembly-RISC-V
Applied 32-bit Booth’s multiplication and restoring division algorithms, producing 64-bit products and signed-correct results. Added sign-handling logic for division by applying absolute-value preprocessing and post-operation correction. Validated arithmetic across varied positive and negative inputs using custom register-level test cases in RARS.
